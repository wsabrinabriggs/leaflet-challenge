Hello and thank you for reading my code.

Please use newlogic.js as my JavaScript file for this challenge. There is no part 2 included in my challenge as I was unable to complete part 1 in its entirety at this time. My next steps to update this challenge include learning how to plot my data using circles with Leaflet and how to include popups as well as a legend.
